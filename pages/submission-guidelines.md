#### End user documentation
These instructions describe the steps necessary to create a new page for your container.

-- Create a new directory with the same name as your workflow/tool/etc in the `docs` directory.  
-- Copy the `_config.yaml` and `basic-documentation` files from the `templates` directory into the new directory in the `pages` directory.  
-- Follow the instructions in the template.  
-- If you already have documented your container elsewhere, you can simply link to it like in [this example](https://github.com/einfra-no/sensitive-data-containers/blob/master/pages/Selma/Selma.md). 
-- Push the changes to the repository to publish the instructions etc to the website.  
-- Verify that all links work as they are supposed to.
