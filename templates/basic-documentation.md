# "Name of your container(workflow/tool/service etc)" in "the infrastructure it's been tested in"
Logo or other image if it exists

## Description
Write a few key sentences here about what the container provides, and that this page documents how it was tested on which sensitive data infrastructure.

## Homepage of container
Link to the generic home of the container.

## Container version/release
* Version of the container itself (and its full set of related code)

## Other relevant versions
* Version of the container technology that was used for testing
* Versions of any other dependencies on the system that the container was run/tested on, that is known to be relevant.
* For workflows, versions of major tools in the workflow.

## Install instructions
Document how to install the software on this sensitive data platform it has been tested on  
* TSD instructions, or HUNT-Cloud instructions, or SAFE etc
* Each platform will have its own separate test web page like this.

## Hardware/resource requirements
* Resources typically required for production use (often the same as chosen for the actual test below).

## Test data
Describe briefly the test data selected.
* A mandatory real size dataset that will give an impression of the running time and corresponding needed resources to complete the anlaysis in this infrastructure. Include instruction on obtaining the input data (i.e. from a shared area in the infrastructure or online location).
* Preferably also have a small toy dataset to simply start a small (complete) test run of the container, without do the full scale test.

## Testing instructions 
Instructions for how to run the workflow or container with the test data.

## Testing results with respect to resources
The running time, memory consumption, input size and output size. "Rule of thumb guideline results", not exact benchmark results.
